* Mulan PSL v2 as the overall license.
* Apache-2.0 for [scancode-tookit](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit). We modified detection rules of Mulan series licenses in ```scancode-toolkit/src/licensedcode/data/rules``` and ```scancode-toolkit/src/licensedcode/data/licenses```.
* The third-party tool, depends, is from [https://github.com/multilang-depends/depends](https://github.com/multilang-depends/depends).
